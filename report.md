# REPORT

## GOAL: 
learning more about github, and about merge

## DESCRIPTION
### Ceneral steps:
1) Creating repository with README.md by branch master
2) Creating aditional 3 branches: master, rab1, rab2, rab3
3) For each branch I added one or two files, folder and some changes README.md
4) I merge branches rab1 rab2 rab3 with branch master by command, for example, for rab1: 
```
git merge --no-ff rab1 -m "Merge with rab1"
```
5) I had conflicts for each merge, because I had different changes, for instance, for branches master and rab1. I have solved them by manualy.
6) I removed README.md, folder src and add report.md. I did it for one commit.
